## Chapter 1

### Bits
Bits are any kind of two-valued things usually described as zeros and ones. Any piece of discrete information van be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

An example how bits could look like are: 00110101101

### Values
To be able to work with such quantities of bits, the bits must be separated into chunks that represent pieces of information. 
Those chunks of information are called values in a javascript environment.
### Return values
